A simple page used to demo the basics of HTML &amp; CSS

This repository is made for use in a workshop designed to teach young students how to code. Together we work through the basics of document setup, HTML tags, images and css styling.

This code base is used in collaboration with this workshop [agenda](https://github.com/nattydodd/code-girls-agenda)
